## Investigating and cracking the vulnerabilities of WEP wireless "security"

Wi-Fi Systems have notably increased in usage to the point that they are almost ubiquitous in corporate, home, and public settings. To keep information private and prevent unauthorized access to Wi-Fi networks, the WEP algorithm was created. However, it fails to meet its desired goals due to inherent flaws in its implementation. In this project, we will explain the WEP standard in its dierent components. Using this knowledge, we will explain the flaws in this system intended for network security, and will demonstrate an attack exploiting them using aircrack-ng.
